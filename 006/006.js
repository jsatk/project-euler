// Utility

// Since our method is exclusive of the higher number we add 1 to it.
// I think this is better for the user as they don't have to remember
// that lower is inclusive but upper is exclusive.  For our purposes
// we don't need a lower bound, but I figured lets write the utility
// method now.  It may pay dividends later.
// JavaScript really needs a `range` method ðŸ˜‘
