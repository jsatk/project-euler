# Project Euler Solutions

![](https://projecteuler.net/profile/jsatk.png)

This repository contains my solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems.

## Goals

### To educate myself on various new-to-me or long-forgotten-by-me mathematical principals

I've never been particularly great at math or mathematical programming and I want to fix that.  I want to stretch myself as both programmer and a life-long student.

### To write all code in the most efficient and human-readable way possible

I am not interested in solving these problems in as few characters as possible.  I want to solve them in such a way that even the most junior of programmers can read the solutions and understand what is going on.  The cognitive load for each step in the solution should be as minimal as possible

### To use Project Euler problems to learn new languages

I want to solve each of these in multiple languages and use this as an excuse to learn more.

### To have fun solving mathematical puzzles

Yep.

## Rules

1. No Googling for the answer
    * I can Google for specific questions I have such as syntax questions or specific mathematical formulas I know exist.  But Googling "Project Euler #4 in Scala" defeats the purpose of this entirely.
1. Organize and comment code in such a way that it is as readable as humanly possible
    * I want others to learn and/or see my solution and suggest ways I can improve it.
1. Favor functional programming principals
    * No classes.  No `this`.  No re-assigning variables unless absolutely necessary (I.E. For JavaScript favor `const` over `let` or `var`).
